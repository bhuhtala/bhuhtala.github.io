        <section>
			<h3>Let Me Introduce Myself!</h3>
            	<p>
                    My name is Delilah and I live in Waco, Texas with my dog Benji.<br> <img src="benjiadriene.png" alt="benjiadriene"> <br>
                    Cooking has been my passion for almost a decade, and it all started when I was done being afraid to get crafty in the kitchen. 
                    I was the person who could barely boil water without something going wrong, so if I can do it, you can too!

        	<h3>My Fall Favorites</h3>
            	<p>Three of my favorite fall recipes to make are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Butternut Squash Soup</li>
                        <li>Pumpkin Alfredo Pasta</li>
                        <li>Maple Apple Blondies</li>
                    </ul>

        	<h3>What Else Besides Cooking?</h3>
            	<p>
                    We all know there is much more to life than food... although no experience seems complete without it! Benji and I love to get outside
                    and enjoy the weather as much as we can. We'll toss a frisbee around, go for walks, and even do yoga in the park!
